# Chako Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

Chako is built as a modern web application with a clear separation between frontend and backend services:

### Frontend Architecture
- Single Page Application (SPA) using Vue.js with TypeScript
- Built with Vite for optimal development experience
- Bootstrap-based UI components for consistent design
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessibility-focused implementation

### Backend Architecture
- Microservices architecture using Python 3.12
- REST APIs deployed on AWS Lambda
- API Gateway for request routing and management
- Cognito authentication with Google SSO
- Aurora PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security

### Infrastructure
- AWS-based cloud infrastructure
- S3 and CloudFront for frontend hosting
- Lambda and API Gateway for backend services
- Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless v2 for database
- Cognito for authentication and authorization
- CodePipeline for automated deployments

## Security Architecture

### Authentication
- Google SSO integration via AWS Cognito
- JWT-based token authentication
- Secure session management

### Data Security
- Row-Level Security in PostgreSQL
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Least privilege access control
- XSS and CSRF protection

## Deployment Architecture

### CI/CD Pipeline
- AWS CodePipeline for automated deployments
- Separate build stages for frontend and backend
- Automated testing and quality checks
- Infrastructure as Code using AWS CDK

### Resource Naming
All AWS resources follow the 'chako-' prefix convention:
- Frontend: chako-frontend-*
- Backend: chako-backend-*
- Database: chako-database-*
- Authentication: chako-auth-*
